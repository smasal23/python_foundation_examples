# Arithmetic Operations – Python Foundations

## Overview
This folder contains **Python implementations of basic arithmetic operations**, developed to strengthen foundational programming skills.  
Each script focuses on a single arithmetic concept and is written using clear logic, meaningful variable names, and function-based structure.

These examples form the base for understanding numerical computation in Python, which is essential for automation, data processing, and engineering applications.

## Concepts Covered
- Addition of numbers
- Area calculation
- Unit conversion
- Power and cube operations
- Temperature conversion
- Simple interest calculation
- Geometric area computations
