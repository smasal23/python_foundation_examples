# Arithmetic Operations – Python Foundations

## Overview

This folder contains Python implementations of fundamental arithmetic and numerical computation exercises developed to strengthen core programming skills.
Each script focuses on a specific mathematical concept and is structured using clear logic, meaningful variable naming, and modular function-based design.

These examples form a foundation for understanding numerical computation in Python — a critical skill for automation, data processing, analytics, and engineering workflows.
