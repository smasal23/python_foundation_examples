# Conditional Statements – Python Foundations

## Overview

This folder contains Python implementations demonstrating conditional logic, one of the core building blocks of programming.
Each script applies decision-making using `if`, `elif`, and `else` constructs to solve logical and real-world validation problems.

These examples build a strong understanding of control flow, which is essential for automation logic, rule-based systems, data validation, and engineering workflows.

## Concepts Covered

* Decision making using conditional statements
* Comparison and logical operators
* Input validation and branching logic
* Handling edge cases and boundary conditions
* List membership checks
* Divisibility and number property evaluation

## How to Run

From the root of the repository or the conditions folder:

```bash
python filename.py
```

Example:

```bash
python leap_year.py
```

## Purpose

The objective of this collection is to strengthen logical reasoning, structured decision-making, and validation design in Python.
Mastering these fundamentals builds the groundwork for developing robust automation pipelines, intelligent control systems, and data processing applications.
