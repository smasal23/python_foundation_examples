# Conditional Statements – Python Foundations

## Overview
This folder contains **Python implementations demonstrating conditional logic**, one of the core building blocks of programming.  
Each script focuses on decision-making using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to solve real-world and logical problems.

These examples help build a strong understanding of control flow, which is essential for automation logic, validations, and rule-based systems.

## Concepts Covered
- Decision making using conditional statements
- Comparison and logical operators
- Input validation
- Handling edge cases and errors
