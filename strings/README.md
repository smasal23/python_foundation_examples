# String Operations – Python Foundations

## Overview
This folder contains **Python implementations focused on string and digit manipulation**, which are essential for handling text-based data and input processing.  
Each script demonstrates common string operations using simple, readable logic and built-in Python functions.

These examples help build a solid foundation for text processing, validation, and data handling tasks.

---

## Concepts Covered
- String traversal and manipulation
- Removing and handling whitespace
- Reversing strings
- Digit extraction and processing
- Even and odd digit separation
- Type conversion between strings and numbers
